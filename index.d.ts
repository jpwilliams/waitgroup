 * A WaitGroup waits for a collection of actions to finish.

 * At the same time, `wait` can be used to return a promise that resolves when all actions have finished.
 * 
 * The class doesn't implement the race-condition requirements that the Golang package has due to the
 * way Node functions, meaning `add`, `done` and `wait` can be called at any time, in any order.
